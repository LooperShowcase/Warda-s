        Beauty is commonly described as a feature of objects that makes them
        pleasurable to perceive. Such objects include landscapes, sunsets,
        humans and works of art. Beauty, together with art and taste, is the
        main subject of aesthetics, one of the major branches of philosophy. As
        a positive aesthetic value, it is contrasted with ugliness as its
        negative counterpart.

      <h2>skin care</h2>

      <p>
        Skin care or skincare is a range of practices that support skin
        integrity, enhance its appearance, and relieve skin conditions. They can
        include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure, and appropriate
        use of emollients. Practices that enhance appearance include the use of
        cosmetics, botulinum, exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing,
        microdermabrasion, peels, retinol therapy, and ultrasonic skin
        treatment. Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such
        as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of
        dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries.

    <h2>make-up</h2>

    <p>
      The Make-Up is an American post-punk band from Washington, D.C. formed in
      1995, consisting of ex-Nation of Ulysses frontman Ian Svenonius on vocals,
      James Canty on guitar and organ, Steve Gamboa on drums, and Michelle Mae
      on bass guitar.[1] The Make-Up were joined in late 1999 by a fifth member,
      Alex Minoff (of the groups Golden and Extra Golden),[2] who played guitar
      with the group until the band's dissolution in early 2000.[3]
